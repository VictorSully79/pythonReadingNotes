# Python Scope

notes taken from <https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/>

## Scope

- Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

- Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

Scope allows variables to be accessed only in parts of the code where the variable is needed.  If a variable is accessible
in the part of the code you are working on it is referred to as "In Scope" if it is not, it is "Out of Scope"

## Names and Scopes in Python

Python uses the location of the name assignment or definition to associate it with a particular scope.
