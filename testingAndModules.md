# In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

notes taken from <https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932>

## Unit Tests

Pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the bahaviour of code.

Tests should start our basic.

Test file name should follow the same name of the module name. 

Structure

1. Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
2. Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour)
3. Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
